# Banking-Application-Model
This Python Jupyter notebook calculates interest rates of three different banks in the Madison, New Jersey area. These banks are Chase Bank, Lakeland Bank, and PNC Bank. The goal of this project is to see how much money a customer can from each bank's interest rates. We know that each bank computes and pays interest differently (compounded annually, continuously, or parabolic). Which bank has the highest interest rate? Which bank has the lowest interest rate?<br>
<br>
These questions are answered, but then taken a step further. How much money would a customer have in 10, 20, and 100 years at each of these banks if they deposited $1000 once and never touched the account again?  This question is answered using a time series which displays the amount of money at the end of each of the 11 years (years 0 to 10).<br>
<br>
This then begs the question: what interest rate would each bank have to have for returns on investment to be equal across all three?
